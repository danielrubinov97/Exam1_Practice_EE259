### From Scratch Combination of Projects 0, 1, and 2. Possible improvements branch?

###### Possible fork into inheritance from scratch but with some optimizations for input files (sample_p0.h)

__ PROJECT 0: __

Purpose of project 0:
	Write a C++ class definition called COUNTER which calculates the number of passing and failing grades in a list of grades.

*This doesn't make any sense because this is not the actual purpose of project 0. Even though this is stated on ho_p0.*

True purpose of project 0 is to:
	Instantiate (load into program) an object with students ids then,
	list the ids in specific orders (1, -1, and invalid).

###### Possibly look into altering p0.h where the program isn't limited to one file, and can be called in multiple times. So for ifstream input_file_p0 (VARIABLE, ios::in); where the VARIABLE is input the by the main user (using cin >> ).

So summary/spec of project 0 is to:
	Read a file of student Ids and collect the student Ids in an array to use later.
	Then create a method that uses these ids and lists them into an output file.
